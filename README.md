# generate_nonintersect_eulerian_path
The generate_nonintersect_eulerian_path function is used to create a non-intersecting Eulerian path for a 3D graph. It takes two arguments: start_points_file and end_points_file, which are file paths to files containing the start and end points of the graph, respectively.
