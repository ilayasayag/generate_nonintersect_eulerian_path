#Project: Non-Intersecting Eulerian Path Generation
This project presents a Python implementation of an algorithm to generate a non-intersecting Eulerian path for a 3D graph. The main script, generate_nonintersect_eulerian_path.py, performs the complete process of creating such paths, starting from reading the graph data from input files, initializing and validating the graph, and finally outputting the resultant path.

#Dependencies
The project relies on the NetworkX package for creating, manipulating, and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It is advised to install NetworkX using pip:

pip install networkx

#Key Functions
##find(G, orders, source = None)
This function takes a graph G, a dictionary orders that tracks the relative position of each edge concerning nodes, and an optional source node to start from. The function checks if the graph is Eulerian, makes a copy of it, and then begins to find valid semi-paths. The function uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph. It adds and removes nodes from a stack, and when a node with no further traversable edges (a dead end) is found, it pops from the stack. When all nodes are explored, the function returns a dictionary of valid semi-paths (ret) and a map of edges (edge_map).

##connect_dict(routes, met, nodata)
This function connects the semi-paths (generated by the find function) into a single, non-intersecting Eulerian path. The function takes as arguments a dictionary of semi-paths (routes), a UnionFind data structure (met), and a dictionary of "trouble nodes" (nodata). The function iterates over the nodes, orders them by their position, and connects routes until all routes of a node belong to the same set. The function returns the final non-intersecting Eulerian path.

#Usage
To use the script, pass the start and end points files as arguments while calling the generate_nonintersect_eulerian_path function from a Python environment.

generate_nonintersect_eulerian_path(start_points_file, end_points_file)

##Known Issues and Limitations
The project assumes that the input graph is Eulerian. The find function will raise a NetworkXError if the graph is not Eulerian.

##Future Work
The script is currently a standalone function. Further development could involve integration into a larger framework or adding additional functionality to handle more complex scenarios.
